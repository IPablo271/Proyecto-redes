# XMPP Chat Client
This project is a chat client developed in JavaScript using the @xmpp/client library. It allows users to log in to an XMPP server, create accounts, send individual and group messages, manage contacts, set presence states, and more. The client runs in the command line and provides an interactive user interface to perform these actions. It connects to an XMPP server (alumchat.xyz) and uses XMPP protocols for communication and contact management. The code implements multiple features such as logging in, adding contacts, joining group chats, setting presence states, deleting accounts, and more.
